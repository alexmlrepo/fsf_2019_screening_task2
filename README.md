# fsf_2019_screening_task2

> Keeping in mind that a user needs a maximum screen size for specific purpose like CSV file editing and Plotting the graph I have made two seperate files which are capable of running independent.   

>CSV Manipulator.py ===> Editing,Saving,Loading Spreadsheet.

>PlotterScipt.py===>For plotting by loading file(You can Manipulate Graph too).

>I had also Combined both by introducing a OpenPlotter button

PS. It's all your choice How you want to use it.
